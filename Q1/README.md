To answer the question
# We want to highlight 10 wines to increase our sales. Which ones should we choose and why?
 we might consider the following criteria:

- Ratings: Wines with higher average ratings might be more appealing to customers.
- Price: Moderately priced wines (neither too cheap nor too expensive) could be attractive for a broad audience.
- Top Lists: Wines that are already on top lists can be highlighted as they might have a reputation.
- Discount: Wines that are currently on discount might encourage more sales.
- Popularity: Wines with a higher number of ratings indicate they are popular and thus can be highlighted.
