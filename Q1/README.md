To answer the question
# We want to highlight 10 wines to increase our sales. Which ones should we choose and why?
 we might consider the following criteria:

High average rating:

    Trust and Quality: A high average rating is generally seen as an indicator of a product's quality. Customers tend to trust peer reviews and place a lot of weight on the average rating of a product when making a purchase decision.
    Visibility and Recommendation Systems: Products with high ratings often get promoted more, both by human curators and recommendation algorithms. They are more likely to be featured in "Top Rated" lists or recommended to users browsing online platforms.
A significant number of ratings (to ensure reliability):

    Reliability: A product with a high rating based on a small number of reviews can be misleading. It might just be that those few users had a particularly good experience, or they might be biased in some way. A high rating based on a large number of reviews is generally more reliable and trustworthy.
    Social Proof: A product with many reviews signals that many people have tried it. This provides social proof, which can influence other potential buyers to consider the product.
Reasonable price (if we want to target a larger audience):

    Market Penetration: If the goal is to increase sales by reaching a broader audience, it's often beneficial to highlight products that are priced reasonably. Expensive products might be of high quality, but they can alienate a segment of potential buyers who are budget-conscious.
    Price-Quality Perception: While extremely low prices can sometimes lead to perceptions of low quality, a reasonably priced product with high ratings can strike a balance in the customer's mind between quality and value for money. This can lead to increased sales as customers feel they're getting a good deal.
