By analyzing the dataset, we identified key parameters that customers value the most: average rating, the volume of ratings, and price. 

The bigger the bubble the higher the volume of rating.

The price point, another crucial factor, without compromising on the quality we can give our customers more wide choice.

- Average Rating (Descending): This is a direct measure of the perceived quality of the wine by consumers. 
A higher average rating indicates that consumers generally found the wine to be of better quality. 
Highlighting wines with high average ratings can boost sales because potential buyers often trust the 
collective opinions of previous buyers.

- Number of Ratings (Descending): A wine with a high average rating but only a
 few ratings might not be as reliable as one with a high average rating based on hundreds or thousands of ratings. 
 By sorting by the number of ratings (after average rating), we ensure that the top wines are not only 
 highly rated but also have a broad consensus about their quality.

- Price (Ascending): When all else is equal (i.e., two wines have the same average rating and number of ratings),
 it makes sense to highlight the more affordable option first. 
 This can be attractive to consumers looking for good value.

Ratings Count > 30: By filtering wines that have more than 30 ratings, 

we're focusing on wines that have a significant amount of feedback. 
This reduces the chance of highlighting wines that might have high ratings due to a small number of potentially biased reviews.
