# Top Cabernet Sauvignon Wine Recommendations

## Introduction
For our VIP client who expressed a preference for Cabernet Sauvignon wines, we have curated a list of the top 5 recommendations based on data from the Vivino database.

## Methodology
1. **Wine Identification**: We began by identifying wines that have "Cabernet Sauvignon" in their names. This approach was taken due to the lack of a direct relationship between wines and grapes in the database.
2. **Rating Consideration**: Once the Cabernet Sauvignon wines were identified, we extracted the vintages associated with these wines.
3. **Ranking**: The vintages were then ranked based on their average ratings. In the event of ties in the average rating, vintages with a higher number of ratings were prioritized.

## Recommendations
Based on the above methodology, the following vintages were identified as top recommendations:

1. **Scarecrow Cabernet Sauvignon 2015**
   - Average Rating: 4.8
   - Number of Ratings: 243
2. **Caymus Special Selection Cabernet Sauvignon 2017**
   - Average Rating: 4.7
   - Number of Ratings: 1890
3. **Leonetti Cabernet Sauvignon 2006**
